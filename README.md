# CV practise

Summer practise.

Just begining in computer vision.

## Structure:

Each folder contains file `task_description.pdf` with description of the task.

Other files contains some parts of my solution.

## File Guide
* `add_learning` - transfer learning in CV
* `face_points` - simple CNN for facial-keypoints detection
* `learning` - HOG-based road sign classificator
* `pro_gorsky` - simple image channels alignment with image piramide
* `seam_carve` - context-sensitive image scaling
